## TODO

- Add support for other users
- Switch oauth provider (google?)
- Switch all accounts to be free tier by default (also add tiers)
- Limit free tier to x lists of max y items and limited photo size
- Support editing list (how to deal with when categories are removed, check if items are in category and if so show warning)
- Support setting number of bags
